# MultiVoteListener

*MultiVoteListener* is a leightweight listener for Votifier that has been inspired by the Simple Vote Listener. However it adds a couple of features that are required on a server I am working on as an Admin.

The current version of MultiVoteListener comes with the following features:

- Handle multiple vote services independently
- Vault support
- PlayerPoints support
- Run commands through console upon vote
- Run commands through console if player who voted is online
- Customizable messages & broadcasts
- Color code support for messages
- Variables in commands & messages
- ClickEvent on broadcast message - opens vote (or any other valid) URL on player click (This feature is only supported when running a Spigot Server)
- Block unknown player votes
- Enable / disable selected services
- Default service (if no configured service matches an incoming vote)

Need help? Have a feature request?

Feel free to contact me via email, PN, forum, etc,. Since the plugin is running on my server as well I am very motivated to get errors fixed immediatelly once they come to my attention.

Implementation of new features depend on how complex, popular and challenging such a request is. In most cases I will have a look into it and try to provide the requested feature.
